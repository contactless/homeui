### Control Types
The meta topic ```/devices/$SystemId/controls/$deviceUniqueControlId/meta/type``` defines different types of controls that decide which interface is shown to the user.

#### Switch
A control that toggles it's value when pressed by the user.
* Meta topic value: switch
* Possible values: 0 or 1

#### Push button
A stateless push button

* Meta topic value: pushbutton
* Possible values: 1
* Messages may lack retained flag


#### Range
A range slider that takes integer values between 0 and any other integer that is greater 1
* Meta topic value: range
* Possible values: 0 - max
* Default max: 255
Different values can be set by publishing an arbitrary integer that is greater than 1 to ```/devices/$SystemId/controls/$deviceUniqueControlId/meta/max```.

#### RGB color control
R/W control for color
* Meta topic value: pushbutton
* Possible values: "R;G;B" , i.e. three semicolon-delimited numbers.
The numbers itself must be integers between 0 and 255.


#### Text
A read-only control that displays it's value as text.
* Meta topic value: text
* Possible values: Anything

#### Generic value type control
